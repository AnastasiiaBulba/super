Our design team studies real World Cup stadiums, analyzing their unique features, crowd capacity, and atmospheric elements.

Each stadium goes through multiple iterations where we test visual impact, performance optimization, and gameplay flow. The Maracan√£ stadium took over four months to perfect, with countless adjustments to lighting, crowd density, and architectural details. We also work closely with our audio team to create authentic stadium atmosphere with crowd chants, referee whistles, and ball sounds.",
